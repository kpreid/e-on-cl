Parsing bugs:

  Fails to parse:
    N-ary infix operators and update forms ("a + (b, c)") -- deprecated? if so, should report a specific error
    Object expressions in atomic and high-precedence positions:
      x & def y{}
      x & thunk{}
      def x implements def auditor {} {}
      def x {} :y

  Bad parse trees:
    "pragma.enable(\"dot-props\"); a <- ::b"

Meta:
  Allow retrieving pragma change information, or have a state object which holdsÂ it, for persistence across REPL inputs as E-on-Java does
