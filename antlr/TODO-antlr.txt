Parsing bugs:

  Fails to parse:
    Interface expressions (unexpected token "interface")
    Quasi expressions (tagged`` and untagged `` forms) (unexpected token: ["`",<290>,line=229,col=63])
    Object expressions (def and thunk) followed by guards (unexpected token: [":",<126>,line=1,col=10])

  Bad parse trees:  
    x::y expression - parses as three siblings
    Any type of CallExpr followed by [] indexing, e.g. x()[0] or even x[0][1] - produces a tree like (x "get" 0 "get" 1) instead of ((x "get" 0) "get" 1)

Meta:
  Allow retrieving pragma change information, or have a state object which holdsÂ it, for persistence across REPL inputs as E-on-Java does
