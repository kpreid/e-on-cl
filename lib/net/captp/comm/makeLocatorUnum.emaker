/**
 * Each product of this maker represents a presence of the pervasive LocatorUnum service.
 *
 * For Una in general: To hold a reference to any presence of the Unum is conceptually to hold a reference to the Unum as a whole. Therefore, a reference to the Unum may as well always be a reference to a local presence of the Unum. Since it can be, and since this would provide better service, we specify that all references to an Unum will be local.
 * 
 * Therefore, an encoded reference to a presence of Unum that's local to the sending side will be decoded as a reference to a presence of the same Unum local to the receiving side. Therefore, a fulfilled reference to an Unum is always <a href="http://www.erights.org/elib/concurrency/refmech.html">Near</a>, and therefore a reference to an Unum is always eventually Near or Broken.
 * 
 * The LocatorUnum is the only Unum built into E itself. It represents the pervasive vatID/swissNumber lookup service built jointly out of all vats and VLSes. It is used only by SturdyRefs to establish their authority to perform a lookup, and to enable SturdyRefs to maintain this authority as they are copied between vats.
 * 
 * The locatorUnum instance should be a graph exit in every connection in the CapTP system; it does not itself provide __optUncall (which would reveal the Introducer). [XXX is this paragraph correct? -- kpreid]
